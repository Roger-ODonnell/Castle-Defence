<h1>The Plan</h1>
<p>This is a castle defence game where the user defends its land from waves of attacks so far from aliens by placing defenses around the map based on budget, each level passed will gain money and enemy difficulty and variation will increase <strong>(Pending idea down the line of each hit on an enemy giving money)</strong>
<p>The plan with this project is to improve my Unity C# skills, create a fun game from premade assets and keep it open to the public to be forked and changed as wished.</p>
<h5><i>Any features from the public greatly appreciated!</i></h5>
